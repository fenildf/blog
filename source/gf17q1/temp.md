Django Packages is a directory of reusable apps, sites, tools, and more for your Django projects. https://djangopackages.org/
Grids let you compare Django packages to each other. A grid comes with a number of default items compared, but you can add more features in order to get a more specific comparison.
For now, we are trying out Django Packages without the traditional tagging system, because we think that grids give us a lot more specificity.

The quantitative data used in GitHut is collected from GitHub Archive. The data is updated on a quarterly basis.
