## 关于榜单：
http://fintechinnovators.com/about-list

The Fintech 100 is a collaborative effort between H2 Ventures and KPMG and analyses the fintech space globally. The report highlights those companies globally that are taking advantage of technology and driving disruption within the financial services industry.

The benefits of being included on the list go beyond profile. This year, 10 of the top emerging fintech startups will be invited to attend a Fintech Summit in London to pitch their ideas to some of the world’s leading financial institutions, venture capital funds and investors. In addition they will receive professional services support from KPMG, plus membership and discounted deal-success rates with Matchi, the online fintech matchmaking platform.

The Fintech 100 consists of two separate lists: Top 50 Established Fintech List, and the 50 Emerging Stars.

The process for selecting the Top 50 Established Fintech List involves a universal search for the most innovative fintech companies. A comprehensive list is then created, with companies ranked based on four groups of factors: total capital raised, rate of capital raising, location and degree of sub industry disruption and the judging panel's subjective rating of the degree of product, service, customer experience and business model innovation.

The process for selecting the 50 Emerging Stars is necessarily subjective, and involves a search for largely ‘undiscovered’ fintech companies. The judges are looking for the players of the future – a diversity of companies from all over the world with fresh, new, disruptive ideas and industry solutions. The evaluation is far less about size and capital raisings than it is about having an “X factor”.
