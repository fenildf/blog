what their typical day looks like. 各自有各自的不同。
Some wake up by 4am; others don’t start the day until closer to 11am. Some exercise every single day; others write or meditate. Some have their routine planned down to (what seems like) the minute; others keep more of a loose schedule.

但是有一点是明确的，routines help us get into a flow state that unlokcs our ability to be happy and effective every day. 

- Get a decent amount of sleep
- Read things that are interesting to you
- Try to break a sweat daily
- Spend time with people you love
- And when you really need to kick into gear, there’s nothing that a good cup of coffee (or an ice plunge) can’t help with ;-)


### Charlie Hoehn, Author of Play it away

一般会冥想对要做的事情进行可视化。同时每天晚上会把第二天会做的事情罗列出来，还会进行必要的营养补充（那些缺少的维生素和矿物质）

### Tony Robbins

每天会跳到冰水中（毛主席吗....）as a discipline to make my mind know that when I say I'm going to do something, I do it now - no matter how difficult it may seem. 对身体也不错（every cell, nerve, and muscle in your body pumps like crazy when you make that radical of a temperature change. it moves your lymph and makes you ready for anything. completely invigorating.）

### Sam Altman, YCombinator 孵化主席

『try to do the things that i think are important, and be ruthless about not doing things that i don't think are important』. 通常给自己当天确定3个大目标和20个小的待办事项
